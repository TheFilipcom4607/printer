# Intro
Using third-party software control provides an excellent means to enhance the convenience and versatility of your printing experience. The key aspect of these enhancements is the necessity of obtaining a computer to run them. Traditionally, a Raspberry Pi (>gen3) is the preferred choice, but given the ongoing Pi shortage now entering its third year, alternative solutions or creative approaches may be required. Personally, I used a random Asus Laptop with 8GB of RAM and 4 cores for a period, and it effortlessly managed Octoprint. This highlights that while a Raspberry Pi is often recommended and assumed in many guides, almost any computer has the potential to fulfill this role.

    Raspberry Pi, created by the UK-based Raspberry Pi Foundation, is an affordable, credit card-sized computer designed to promote hands-on computer science education. Despite its compact size, it functions as a fully capable computer, supporting various peripherals and running different operating systems, including Linux-based distributions.
