#### [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/){target=_blank} - 8/10

## Description
I use it as a remote control host, Octoprint controls your printer via a web interface while keeping all other software stock. This means little to no improvement in raw performance but big improvements in ease of use.
## Hardware
As mentioned earlier in the "Intro", the go-to option is a Raspberry Pi. Personally, I use the Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB of RAM, but the 2GB model should work as well. I also connect a 720p webcam to my Pi for creating timelapses and video monitoring.
## Bonus
I recomend using the [OctoApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.crysxd.octoapp&hl=en) if you want to check your printer status on your phone. It has a super nice UI, and even has push notifications & support for over 30 popular plugins. (Its on ios & android)
