The key aspect of these enhancements is the necessity of obtaining a computer to run them. Traditionally, a Raspberry Pi (&gt;gen3) is the preferred choice, but given the ongoing Pi shortage now entering its third year, alternative solutions or creative approaches may be required. Personally, I used a random Asus Laptop with 8GB of RAM and 4 cores for a period, and it effortlessly managed Octoprint. This highlights that while a Raspberry Pi is often recommended and assumed in many guides, almost any computer has the potential to fulfill this role.</p> What is a raspberry pi? <p>Raspberry Pi, created by the UK-based Raspberry Pi Foundation, is an affordable, credit card-sized computer designed to promote hands-on computer science education. Despite its compact size, it functions as a fully capable computer, supporting various peripherals and running different operating systems, including Linux-based distributions.</p>"},{"location":"software/klipper/","title":"Klipper","text":"<p>Still WIP, come back later.</p>"},{"location":"software/octoprint/","title":"Octoprint","text":""},{"location":"software/octoprint/#octoprint-810","title":"Octoprint - 8/10","text":""},{"location":"software/octoprint/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>I use it as a remote control host, Octoprint controls your printer via a web interface while keeping all other software stock.
